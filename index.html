            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>We created Euphoric Melody Study Cafe to give students and those who are passionate about learning a place to study, while providing soothing background music.<br> Just interested in hanging out with friends or buying a something to drink? Everyone is welcome! We have a separate area for those wanting to just sit and chat. Be sure to check out our <a href="menu.html#menu">menu</a>.</p>

            <h2>Why a Study Cafe?</h2>
            <p>So <strong>why</strong> a study cafe? The idea came from a trip to South Korea. Many students would study at cafes while enjoying something to drink. <br> We wanted to create something like that here, by giving students another option besides at home or at a library to study.</p>
